# FlashTree

**FlashTree** is a high-performance, in-memory key-value store server written in Rust. Think of it as a lightweight, super-fast database you talk to using classic text commandsâ€”ideal for rapid prototyping, learning, small projects, or anywhere you want speed and simplicity.

## ðŸš€ What is FlashTree?

FlashTree is a small server you can run locally or on a server. It stores, retrieves, and deletes hierarchical, structured keys like `user:100:name` incredibly efficiently, making it especially fast and effective for keys with common prefixes.
